I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cst.hitwh.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, 3D vision, IoT, big data and autonomous driving.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xin Hu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/hithuxin) from [School of Computer Science](https://cst.hitwh.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology. I was also advised by [Prof. Xiaowei Hu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/huxiaowei) from [School of Transportation Science and Engineering](https://jtxy.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology.
